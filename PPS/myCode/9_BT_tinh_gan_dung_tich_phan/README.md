- Yes, that's correct. The Simpson's rule uses twice as many points as the Newton-Cotes method. This is because the Simpson's rule approximates the function with a parabolic curve using three equally spaced points, while the Newton-Cotes method approximates the function with a polynomial of degree n using n+1 equally spaced points.
